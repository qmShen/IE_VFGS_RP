\section{Experimental Evaluation}\label{sec:exp}
We evaluate our techniques on two real-world trajectory datasets: \pt{}, \sz{} and \cd{}.
\pt{}~\cite{pt} contains a total of 2.39 million taxi trajectories and 75.67 million of GPS points, and the longest trajectory has 3,490 GPS points.
\sz{}~\cite{sz} consists of 3.07 million taxi trajectories with 53.53 million GPS points, and the longest trajectory has 2,268 GPS points. 
\cd{}~\cite{cd} consists of \QM{0.28} million taxi trajectories with \QM{6.69} million GPS points, and the longest trajectory has \QM{4025} GPS points.  All experiments are conducted on a machine with an Intel i7-8700 CPU, 24 GB memory and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX1080 GPU with 8 GB on-chip memory, running on Windows 10. All methods are implemented in Java 1.8, and the Processing 3 library~\cite{p3} is used for rendering. All datasets and source codes required to reproduce our results are available at~\cite{code}.

%\REPORT{
This section is organized as follows.
In Section~\ref{sec:case}, we present several case studies of the visualization results on the \pt{} datasets to demonstrate the merits of our methods.
% In Section~\ref{sec:case}, we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposal by the case studies on \pt{} and \sz{} trajectory dataset, respectively.
%}
In Section~\ref{sec:user}, we conduct a comprehensive user study to test the effectiveness of our visualization results on practical tasks including \textit{region center identification}, \textit{reachable route inspection} and \textit{traffic flow comparison}. In Section~\ref{sec:quality}, we quantitatively evaluate the visual quality and efficiency of our methods on all these three datasets.
